"No she don't wanna talk
I get it, I get it, I get it get it
But I’m not moving on
She thought i had a problem
I don't have a problem
I thought we make it
Yeah I thought we make it

She put my heart right on a parashoot
Killed it in the first degree
I don't have no time for you, so please don’t have no time for me
Your heart is like a drug and I take it all inspriration
And I know I lost my mind, but I lost it all for you
Sometimes I leave my window open and I hope that you come through
And I hope you do that to

And I tried
No I tried
I tried yeah
And I tried
No I tried
I tried

But she don't wanna talk
I get it, I get it, I get it get it
But I'm not moving on
She thought I had a problem
I don't have a problem
No she don't wanna talk
I get it, I get it, I get it get it
But I'm not moving on
She thought i had a problem
I don't have a problem"
